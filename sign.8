.SH DESCRIPTION
sign adds a cryptographic signature to a file. It can add a clearsign signature
(-c option), create a detached signature (-d option), or add a signature block
to a rpm package (-r option). If no mode is specified, sign does a rpm sign
if the file name ends in ".rpm", otherwise it does a clearsign. If no
file name is specified, sign reads from stdin and writes to stdout.

One can specify a specific user or hash method with the -u and -h option.
Currently sign understands the sha1 and sha256 hashes.

sign does not create the signature by itself, it needs a running signing
daemon (called signd) to do the work. The host and port information is read
from the /etc/sign.conf file.

The -k option makes sign print the keyid instead of signing a file, the
-p option makes it print the public key.

New keys can be created by using the -g option. In case a SSL certification
is also needed (eg. for linux kernel modules) it can be created by using -C 
option afterwards.

Existing keys can be extended using -x option.

.SH SECURITY
sign needs to bind to a reserved port, it thus works only for user root
or needs to be installed suid-root. If the latter is the case, sign
grants the users specified in the "allowuser" lines of the configuration
the right to sign files.

.SH BUGS
sign currently only creates the "header+payload" signature when signing
rpms. It should also add the "header only" signature.

.SH EXIT STATUS
sign returns 0 if everything worked, otherwise it returns 1 and
prints an error message to stderr.
